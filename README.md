circulatortrafficviz

Processing sketch that animates location data collected from the Charm City Circulator's API.  Basemaps with traffic were pulled as screenshots from Google Maps during the same logging period.  

The idea was to see if the effects of traffic on bus spacing would be evident... what do you see?

Made at the "Reinvent Transit" hackathon at Betamore in Baltimore, MD, 2013.
